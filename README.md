# Bicep Detection Dataset

This repository provides a labeled dataset curated for training and evaluation of machine learning models trained on detecting biceps in human pictures. 
The dataset can be used for applications in computer vision such as human pose estimation, fitness tracking, gesture analysis and anatomical feature recognition.

## Dataset Overview

With the data you want to get in CSV with labeled data You can use:

- **Classification**: Determine whether a bicep is present.

* **OBJECT DISCOVERY**: Detect and locate the bicep in an image (bounding boxes or key points, if applicable).

It is designed to be:

- Lightweight and easy to preprocess

- Compatible with major ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn)

- Useful for benchmarking and reproducible research
